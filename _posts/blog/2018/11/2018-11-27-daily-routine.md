Today my work focused on learning about HTML/JSP to build a basic web page which could let me insert the data which I input in a form on the page, and the experiments were successful.  

More details could be found [here](/2018/11/27/browser_get_and_post).  

The next target is to control the MySQL with Arduino, so I could input the sensor data to database directly.
