# Missing Dock when remote access Ubuntu 18.04 Gnome Desktop with XRDP

The Dock will occasionally disappear when login to the account, re-login or reboot could solve it temporary,

Lei Mao (https://leimao.github.io/blog/Ubuntu-Dock-Disappear/) provided a good way to solve it. It's not permanent, but it works.

These steps will restart the gnome shell, and there's no need to reboot any more.
