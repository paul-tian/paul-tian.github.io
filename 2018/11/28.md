After a day's working and testing, my Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 could add the data I want into the ```'demo'.'user'``` table which I created in this [note](/notes/tomcat_and_mysql).

More details could be found [here](/notes/arduino_get_and_post).  

Next step is to send real sensor data to database, which might be a challenge because of the sampling rate and data type(most of them are doubles).
