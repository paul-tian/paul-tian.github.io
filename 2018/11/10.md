I'm now trying to purify the codes in repo [Arduino-JY901-Serial](https://github.com/tic-toc-developer/Arduino-JY901-Serial) to make the IMU Serial connection only, the IIC mode is not my goal.  
The work goes on within ```JY901.cpp```, the writing of host controlling functions are on the go.  

BTW I've successfully changed my AppleID and Paypal ID's region to US, but I still need to find a US telephone number. Temporarily, I use a ```Skype Number + Godaddy SmartLine Number``` to receive SMS and calls, but the cost is kind of high. Still working on it.
