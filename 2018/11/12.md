Today I read part of the book *Machine Learning*, had Tower used my GPG key to sign the codes, but the coding mission has been suspended. May be continue tomorrow?

## How to enable the gpg signature on git

After key generation following [Official Guidance](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-commit-signature-verification/), use terminal to operate as below:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

and copy the string after sec as SEC

```bash
git config --global gpg.program /Path/to/GPG
```

My brew installed gpg at ```/usr/local/Cellar/gnupg/2.2.10/bin/gpg ```

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey SEC
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

after above try
```bash
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
```

if ```Inappropriate ioctl for device``` approach try add
```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```
in ```.bash_profile``` and

```bash
source .bash_profile
```

test again, it should work and [git-tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) should work with signature now.

### Important

If used a secure passphrase for the key, the Tower client may still can't sign, if so, do

```bash
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
```
in terminal first, it may ask you for the secure passphrase, unlock it and problem should been solved.
