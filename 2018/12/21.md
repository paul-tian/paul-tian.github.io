# Dec 21, 2018

It has been a long time since the last update of my blog.  
During this period, I tried to modify and polish the codes for data gathering from JY901 model to MySQL database.  
It was not an easy job after all, still I finally narrowed the interval time to an acceptable value. The details are all in the note [About Data Gathering](/notes/data_gather_and_store).
