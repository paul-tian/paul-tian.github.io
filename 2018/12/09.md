It spent me a some time figuring out how to combine the hardware with my little head. But the first thing is that my Arduino boards are all come to me with headers mounted(Actually the [MKR WiFi 1010](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkr-wifi-1010) doesn't provide a header-free version and my [MKR1000](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkr1000-with-headers-mounted) comes with the [MKR IoT Bundle](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-iot-mkr1000-bundle), which is a header mounted version, not a [header-free version](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-mkr1000)).  
Unmounting the headers is not a easy work, I cost a lot of time to achieve it, as the picture shown:

Coding is almost done, ready for the data gathering.
