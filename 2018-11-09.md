For now, neally all the comments about ```JY901.h``` have been added, which may help to understand codes more easily.<br>
The work goes on the with ```JY901.cpp```, where I need to complete the comments and implement all the function the manufacturer provided(original repo foucused on implement the JY901 -> host functions, the host controlling functions are ignored).<br>
The repo link is [Arduino-JY901](https://github.com/tic-toc-developer/arduino-JY901).<br>
Also, the learning about Machine Learning has started.I'm curious about how long will it take to read the book *Machine Learning*(Chinese Version, Zhihua Zhou).
